# WEATHER APP 
## About Weather App Created With React.js
In the project in order to manage states I used Context API and its useContext hook to spread states to other components. I used Weather API datas to display weather report forecasts on my DOM and I fetched the datas by using Axios to make a fetch request. I created a isLoading state in order to display Spinner Component that I created, when user make a request to display weather reports isLoading state returns false and user sees a spinner at the center of the dom until data fetched. Additionally I created an Error component so that whenever user come across API Fetch error the ErorrComponent appears at the center of the DOM. It was certainly good project to brush up on React Coding skills. I have learnt a lot. I hope you like it as well.

## ABOUT ME 
Hello Everyone. Let me briefly introduce myself to you. First of all I am so glad to see that you are looking at my project. I am 26 years old. I am a mechanical engineer. After my graduation I worked as an engineer in the field somewhere in the region of 5 months. However, after working a few month I felt like it was not for me and I was not happy. After That I decided to research on different careers specifically those that include web development, because I have always been interested in coding, software, computer and its components. After extensive research, I grew more interest towards coding and I felt driven and motivated to become a genuinely brilliant frontend web developer. I would like to add that my education background that engineering has taught me how to work in an higly orginised and systematic way which allows me to learn in an effective way. What I mean is my enginnering background has been making great contrubutions to my learning process. I hope I did not bore you with my brief introduction.
